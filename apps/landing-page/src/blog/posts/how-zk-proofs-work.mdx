Zero-knowledge proofs are the backbone of zkAd's privacy-preserving technology. Let's explore how this cryptographic innovation enables targeted advertising without compromising user privacy.

## What Are Zero-Knowledge Proofs?

A zero-knowledge proof is a cryptographic method where one party (the prover) can prove to another party (the verifier) that they know a value, without revealing any information about the value itself.

## How zkAd Uses ZK Proofs

### 1. Local Profile Creation
Your preferences and interests are stored locally on your device, encrypted and never shared.

### 2. Cryptographic Verification
When an advertiser wants to target specific demographics, zkAd uses ZK proofs to verify if you match the criteria without revealing your actual data.

### 3. Privacy-Preserving Matching
The advertiser knows their ad reached the right audience, but learns nothing about individual users.

## Benefits for Everyone

- **Users**: Complete privacy while seeing relevant ads
- **Advertisers**: Effective targeting without liability of handling user data
- **Ecosystem**: Trust and transparency through cryptographic guarantees

## The Technical Details

Our implementation uses state-of-the-art zk-SNARK circuits optimized for advertising use cases, ensuring fast verification times while maintaining bulletproof privacy.
